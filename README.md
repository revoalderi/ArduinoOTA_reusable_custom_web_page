##Example pages for ArduinoOTA

Full article and more information on https://www.mischianti.org/category/tutorial/esp8266-tutorial/esp8266-firmware-management-tutorial/

I create this page in VanillaJS and CSS standard to understand how to change default page with a better and more beautiful one.

![Page sample](https://www.mischianti.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Custom-Arduino-OTA-page.gif)

First install node.js > 12
Then launch 'npm i' command 

You can find the original source code on ./src directory

After launch 'npm run dist' you can find minified and gzipped file to minified directory.
