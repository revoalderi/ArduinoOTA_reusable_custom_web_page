##Example pages for ArduinoOTA

I create this page in VanillaJS and CSS standard to understand how to change default page with a better and more beautiful one.

First install node.js > 12
Then launch 'npm i' command 

You can find the original source code on ./src directory

After launch 'npm run dist' you can find minified and gzipped file to minified directory.
